#Collaborative Report Writing For Environmental Impact Assessment

##Introduction

##Current Typical Collaboration Processes - How We Work
At present the main tools we use revolve around the Microsoft Office 2013 suite, in particular Word 2013 and Outlook 2013. It was only in August 2014 that Atkins upgraded; previously we had been using Office 2007. Word 2013 offers significant improvements on collaborative functions, which will be addressed in the next section.

To paint a picture of how multiple teams combine to create one ES, consider the following scenario. An ES requires, say, nine specialist chapters - this means that there are ten teams contributing to it - nine specialist teams and one coordination team. Each team has one originator, one checker, and one reviewer - thirty people. Each specialist chapter will go through at least three versions before it gets to the coordination team for collation; with an original version updated twice to reflect first checking comments and then review comments. The introductory and conclusion chapters (for the sake of simplicity considered here to be one chapter) go through the same process - thirty chapter versions in all. Once received by the coordination team, it is almost certain that the coordination check will identify issues that the specialist team need to address, resulting in **at least** one extra iteration of each chapter. Further, each specialist chapter has now been contributed to by **four** people: specialist originator, checker, and reviewer; and the coordination checker. Similar further iterations could follow reviews by:
* separate planning team
* client's lawyers
* client
* final coordination reviewer

This assumes that no issues arise independent of the review process, such as changes in design, changes to red line boundary, scoping or consultation responses that lead to a change in assessment requirements.

All in all, this means that there are at least thirty people contributing to multiple versions of ten different chapters. In order to maintain version control and to make it easier to identify issues and changes, some or all of the following is likely to be used:
* Some form of file naming system, perhaps including the date, last user's initials, version numbering or lettering
* Folder structures in Windows Explorer - such as "As received from teams" for the first version; "Review version to client"; "Final for issue", and so on
* Comments to highlight issues that need addressing by other people
* Tracked changes  so that the next person can quickly identify what has been changed. There is a tension between retaining tracked changes to maintain auditability and prevent the same issues getting raised repeatedly by different reviewers; and readability. Realistically a complex chapter that had been through the review mill would be an unreadable mess by the time it got to the client or overall reviewer for their sign-off

This is technically known as A Complete 'Mare.
